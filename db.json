      "body": "A founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people think. I didn’t have an answer, and after reflecting on it more, I think it's the wrong question. Almost everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it's probably important. Caring too much makes you a sheep. But you need to be at least a little in tune with others to do something useful for them. It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention. The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn’t value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people’s opinions on a very long time horizon—as long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong. You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other ways–the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness. You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.",

      "body": "You may think it’s quite uninteresting, but read through. I might just surprise you. I apologise, I’m a tad bit rusty (no pun intended) in my writing skills. Owing to the fact that I’ve hardly written anything other than SEO optimised blog posts in the past couple years. But again, as I now look down upon my keyboard, it’s starting to come back to me. ‘Lack of a life’ I’m calling this, because that’s how I see myself currently. It’s actually quite a cliché scenario. You reach a stage in life where everything seems boring. Everything moves way too slow, and there’s hardly any personal (or professional) growth in your life, for that matter. … Countless others have gone through this, and countless others will go through this. And when you do, I want you to come back to this incidence I’ll be telling you. ",

      "title": "People don’t like using technology",
      "body": "There’s an inherent tension between how an engineer sees the product under development and how a potential user sees it. Engineers get excited by the technological advances and the number of options exposed in the gadget. A user sees all such complexity as overwhelming and off-putting. It’s easy for a creator to forget that the user has a life to live and using their product isn’t a highlight of her life. Rather, it’s likely a chore. People want their desires to be fulfilled in the most convenient manner. So, if someone wants to go from point A to point B, the most perfect solution would be instant teleportation and not starting the car and driving on the road. People care about their problems, and your solution is only an incidental means to solving those problems. From an engineer’s point of view, internal combustion engines are fantastic – making a good engine requires knowledge and application of thermodynamics, acoustics, metals, and so on. But, for the busy user, it’s a hassle to get into a car, fiddle with the knobs, and then carefully drive to a destination. If the user can avoid all this effort, and get an additional hour of life not spent driving, she will switch from driving to teleportation in a jiffy. Everyone will. While engineers get excited by how sophisticated technology they’re exposing in a product, potential users want none of it. Apple understands this principle deeply as evident from the design of the most successful tech product ever: the iPhone. When the iPhone was launched in 2007, they took great efforts to remove the stylus, which was the dominant mode of interaction with screens until then (and certainly a fascinating example of technology). Apple innovated on the user interface to make interacting with the iPhone’s screen as natural as flipping a magazine. They knew that nobody wanted to use a phone. What people wanted was to call their friends, write emails and browse the Internet. To enable these use cases, they took the latest technology and abstracted away all the complexity from the user. Sure, they could have exposed the variety of configuration options to make the “full” use of iPhone’s underlying technology. But if they did that – like many other phone vendors at that time proudly used to do – they would have killed the iPhone. Remember: a perfect radio is no radio. It’s just music."
